### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
## Ruth H. Carter

I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm currently studying Psychology with a minor in Sociology and a certificate in Applied Statistical Modeling! 

Although I enjoy working with numbers and datasets, I think being able to view the numbers from a psychological and humanistic mindset gives much more meaning to the trends.
